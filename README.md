# Cognos
Cognos Extensions, tools, and Custom Controls to help report developers


### EnterSubmit.zip
This is a javascript file for use in Cognos 11+ in the interactive viewer and in a custom control. The file is packaged as a cognos extension for easy upload. 

If the entersubmit.js file is used in a custom control placed on a prompt page it allows users to press "Enter" or "Return" to submit the form. Secondly, this also sets all text items to have a tabindex of "-1" so that users don't "Tab" into the static text and it moves only between input fields. This is assuming you only have text and prompt fields on the page.
